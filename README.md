## Installation

*Make sure to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 10.0.0 (or higher) installed.*

1. Clone it or fork it.

2. Once you have your local copy, install its dependencies using either Yarn:

```
yarn
```

or npm:

```
npm install
```

or my FAVORITE and the one used to build this project - pnpm:

```
pnpm install
```


## Running

After installed, you can start the application by running it with Yarn:

```
yarn start
```

or npm:

```
npm run start
```

or pnpm:

```
pnpm start
```

3. Create an .env file with the following properties according to your local database configuration:

```
DB_HOST=?
DB_USER=?
DB_NAME=?
DB_PASS=?
```

*This will start the server at `localhost:3000`*
<!-- (if you didn't change the `PORT` property on `.env`) -->
